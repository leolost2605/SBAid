"""
The Simulator package contains the interfaces which are used to communicate
with the different simulators. It also contains classes that are necessary
for creation and implementation of the simulators.
The provided interfaces are implemented by classes within the sub-packages.

The factory pattern is used for construction of the concrete simulators
in order to provide extensibility for new simulators.
